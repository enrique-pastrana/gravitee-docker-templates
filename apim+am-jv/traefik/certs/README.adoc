The following commands are all you need to create a self-signed (wildcard, if you want) SSL certificate:

```
openssl genrsa 2048 > host.key
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 3650 -key host.key > host.cert
...[enter *.domain.com for the Common Name]...
openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -text < host.cert > host.info
cat host.cert host.key > host.pem
chmod 400 host.key host.pem
```
